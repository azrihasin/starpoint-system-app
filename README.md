##  Title of the project. 
Starpoint System Application

##  Introduction
Star Point System App is an application that records star points by utilizing QR codes. The app will be benefited by both IIUM students and event organizers. 
The student only needs to scan the QR code provided by the event organizer, and star points will be awarded to their account. By using this app, the organizer 
will not need to make a spreadsheet that stores studentsâ€™ details, causing a long queue at the entrance of the venue, which is a common occurrence in any event.

##  Objective
- To ease students in finding events to participate in and earn star points.
- To help students keep track of their star points after participating in events.
