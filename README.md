##  Title of the project. 
Star Point System Application

##  Introduction
Star Point System App is an application that records star points by utilizing QR codes. The app will be benefited by both IIUM students and event organizers.
The student only needs to scan the QR code provided by the event organizer, and star points will be awarded to their account.
By using this app, the organizers don't need to create their own spreadsheet to store studentsâ€™ details, which can cause a long queue at the venue, a common occurrence in any event.
Hence, this app can benefit both the students and event organizers by saving time and allowing for smooth progress for the events.
